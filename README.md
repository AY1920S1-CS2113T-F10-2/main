# Duke 2.0

A program for those who prefer to use a desktop app for researching on degrees from NUS' Faculty of Engineering. It primarily uses CLI for inputs, and scrapes information from the NUS database to ensure that the course and module information are always accurate. It allows the user to rank the courses according to their preferences and makes it easier to determine which course they wish to enter.
