# Duke 2.0

A program for those who "prefer to use a desktop app for researching on degrees from NUS' Faculty of Engineering".

## User Guide

For those who wish to use Duke 2.0 as-is, please refer to the [User Guide](docs/README.md).

## Setting up

For those who wish to modify the source files for their own project, or just to see how Duke 2.0 works.

**Prerequisites**

* JDK 11
* Recommended: IntelliJ IDE
* Fork this repo to your GitHub account and clone the fork to your computer
* Gradle integration (Should be done automatically. If not, see Tutorials)

**Importing the project into IntelliJ**

1. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first).
1. Set up the correct JDK version.
   * Click `Configure` > `Structure for new Projects` (in older versions of Intellij:`Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`).
   * If JDK 11 is listed in the drop down, select it. If it is not, click `New...` and select the directory where you installed JDK 11.
   * Click `OK`.
1. Click `Import Project`.
1. Locate the project directory and click `OK`.
1. Select `Create project from existing sources` and click `Next`.
1. Rename the project if you want. Click `Next`.
1. Ensure that your src folder is checked. Keep clicking `Next`.

## Gradle Usage

This assumes the project has been imported as a gradle project. If not, follow the instructions at [Gradle Tutorial](tutorials/gradleTutorial.md).

Gradle Commands | Usage
-----------------|--------------------
`gradlew build` | Runs all available gradle tasks
`gradlew task`| Displays all available gradle tasks
`gradlew checkstyleMain` | Checks source code against a given code style
`gradlew checkstyleTest` | Checks test code against a given code style
`gradlew run` | Runs the main class as specified in build.gradle
`gradlew properties` | Displays the properties of this gradle project
`gradlew shadowjar` | Compiles and creates a standalone executable .jar file

### Using build.gradle
The dependencies and properties of the gradle project can be changed in [build.gradle](build.gradle).

**Shadowjar**
When `gradlew shadowjar` is run, it will create a .jar file in the format {archiveBaseName}-{archiveVersion}.jar.
Modify the the following part in the `build.gradle` file to update the name of the jar file.
```
shadowJar {
	archiveBaseName = "duke"
	archiveVersion = "0.1.0"
	archiveClassifier = null
	archiveAppendix = null
}
```
**Working directory**
The following lines determines the working directory of the gradle project when `gradlew run` is used.
For the gradle project to detect the save file in `../data`, the working directory must be set to `../main/bin`.
```
File runningDir = new File('../main/bin')
runningDir.mkdirs()
tasks.run.workingDir = runningDir
```
**Main class**
This part of `build.gradle` determines which class is to be the main class of the project. 

Using `javafx.Launcher` means Duke 2.0 will launch with a GUI, while using `Main.Duke` means Duke 2.0 will run in console mode only.
```
application {
	// Change this to your main class.
	mainClassName = "javafx.Launcher"
	//mainClassName = "main.Duke"
}
```
