== Introduction

Duke 2.0 (D2) is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for researching on degrees from NUS’ Faculty of Engineering*. More importantly, D2 is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, D2 can handle your queries faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `duke2.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Address Book.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.

* *`list`* : lists all tasks you have saved to it
* **`event`**`University Talk at/25-09-2019 2359` : adds an event named `University Talk` to the Address Book.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd degree shown in the current list
